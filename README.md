## 👋 About Me
I am a **Machine Learning Engineer / Data Analyst** with a Master’s background in **Artificial Intelligence and Data Analysis**, and hands-on experience applying **machine learning, analytics, and data engineering** to real-world problems in **industry and healthcare**.

I focus on:
- building **reliable ML models**
- analyzing **large, complex datasets**
- translating data into **actionable insights** for decision-making

My work emphasizes **practical impact, interpretability, and reproducibility**, rather than experimental or black-box solutions.
